## Chap 1
What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of computing power, databases, storage, applications, and other IT resources over the internet, with pay-as-you-go pricing.

Infrastructure as Software
Cloud computing allows you to stop thinking of your infrastructure as hardware and, instead, treat it (and use it) as software.

Traditional Computing Model
1. Infrastructure as Hardware
2. Hardware Solutions
- Requires space, staff, physical security, planning, capital expenditure.
- Involves long procurement cycles, forcing you to provision capacity based on peak maximums in theory.

Cloud Computing Model
1. Infrastructure as Software
2. Software Solutions
- Flexible.
- Can change more quickly and cost-effectively than hardware solutions.
- Eliminates non-differentiated heavy lifting tasks.

## Chap 2
Advantages of Cloud Computing
1. Massive economies of scale.
2. Due to the aggregate usage of all customers, AWS can achieve higher economies of scale and pass cost savings on to customers.
End guessing capacity.
3. Increases speed and agility.
4. Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers.
5. Expands worldwide in minutes.
